# Machine-Learning-Nueroimaging-Tutuorial
Please watch the YouTube video tutorials and use this code and workbook to work alongside. This is an introductory series and is by no means exhaustive of all machine learning concepts in anyway. There are some best practices included in the code, but there are always arguments to do it one way over another. In general, the code and methods used here are acceptable practice. This tutorial is intended to enable researchers to easily incorporate machine learning into their own analyses. Please share this with your students, undergrads, grads, highschoolers, or anyone who is interested in neuroimaging and machine learning. Education and learning is a right of all humans and should never be limited by the circumstances one is born into.
